C   Am   Dm   G


[Verse 1]
C            Am
Chasing the sun
Dm                  G
Chasing the sun for you
C              Am
Spending the day
Dm               G
Driving away the blues
    C                 Am
And there's nothing like
       Dm                 G
Losing track of the time, who's countin'?
C          Am
Winding around
       Dm                  G
Are we up, are we down the mountain?


[Interlude]
C  Am  Dm  G
C  Am  Dm  G


[Verse 2]
C                   Am
Write a postcard to you
     Dm                  G
When you're in the other room
     C                   Am
Just writing to say that I can't find my clothes
          Dm                      G
If you're lookin for something to do
C                   Am
Drop everything I'm doing
Dm              G
Nobody needs me here
C                    Am
I'll go wherever you are going
Dm                G
I'll be somewhere near


[Verse 3]
C                   Am
I can't seem to get anything done
     Dm                   G
With someone likе you around
C                          Am
Everyone's wondering whеre I've gone
       Dm                   G
Having too much fun, having too much fun
C              Am
Doing nothing, doing nothing
  Dm        G
Busy doing, doing nothing
  C           Am          Dm          G
Busy doing, busy doing, doing nothing


[Pre-Chorus]
C            Am
Chasing the sun
Dm              G
Chasing the sun for you
C              Am
Spending the day
Dm               G
Driving away the blues


[Chorus]
C             Am
Driving away, driving away
Dm               G
Driving away the blues
C             Am
Driving away, driving away
Dm               G
Driving away the blues
C             Am
Driving away, driving away
Dm               G
Driving away the blues


[Outro]
C  Am  Dm  G
C  Am  Dm  G
C  Am  Em   G
