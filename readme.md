# How to use

Run the python file parse.py

Copy paste a URL from ultimate guitar into it

If the song begins with something like `[Intro]`, `[Verse 1]` etc. manually enter it to the start of the song in songs.json (it will be the last entry).

If the first line of the song has chords with leading whitespace you have to manually fix this up as well doing the same method.

Any duplicate URL's entered will be overriden with the most recent.
