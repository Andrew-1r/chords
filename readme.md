# How to use

Run the python file parse.py

Copy paste a URL from ultimate guitar into it

If the song begins with something like `[Intro]`, `[Verse 1]` etc. manually enter it.

If the first line of the song has chords with leading whitespace you have to manually fix this up as well.

Any duplicate URL's entered will be overriden with the most recent.
